#### 1. **Introduction**
The goal of this experiment was to evaluate the performance of different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures—namely, a basic RNN, a stacked RNN, a Bi-Directional RNN, and a hybrid CNN-RNN—on the IMDb sentiment analysis task. Each architecture was tested to assess its ability to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on text input. This report will discuss the results, challenges encountered, and the potential benefits or drawbacks of using a hybrid CNN-RNN approach.

#### 2. **Results Overview**
The models were trained and tested using the IMDb dataset, and the following accuracies were achieved:

- **Basic RNN**: Test Accuracy: *0.779*
- **Stacked RNN**: Test Accuracy: *0.798*
- **Bi-Directional RNN**: Test Accuracy: *0.806*
- **Hybrid CNN-RNN**: Test Accuracy: *0.788*

From these results, the Bi-Directional RNN achieved the highest accuracy, followed by the Stacked RNN and the Hybrid CNN-RNN. The basic RNN, while functional, performed the least well compared to the others.

#### 3. **Challenges Faced**
- **Vanishing Gradients in Stacked RNNs**: As layers were stacked, the issue of vanishing gradients became more prominent, making it harder for the network to learn long-term dependencies. Despite this, the Stacked RNN still outperformed the basic model due to its ability to capture more complex patterns.
  
- **Training Time**: Both the Bi-Directional RNN and Hybrid CNN-RNN architectures took significantly more time to train compared to the basic RNN due to the complexity of additional layers (bi-directional processing and convolution operations).

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: One of the challenges across all models was finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of layers. These factors had a significant impact on performance, particularly for the hybrid architecture.

#### 4. **Benefits and Drawbacks of Hybrid CNN-RNN Approach**
- **Benefits**:
  - **Feature Extraction with CNN**: The convolutional layer in the hybrid model helped in extracting local patterns (e.g., short n-grams or specific word phrases) that the RNN might not capture as effectively on its own. This proved beneficial in tasks where certain local patterns influence sentiment.
  - **Reducing Input Dimensionality**: The MaxPooling layer after the CNN reduced the dimensionality of the data before it was passed to the RNN, potentially helping reduce computational complexity.

- **Drawbacks**:
  - **Performance**: Despite the added complexity of combining a CNN with an RNN, the hybrid model did not outperform the Bi-Directional RNN. This suggests that while the CNN can help with local feature extraction, the sequential nature of the data may be better handled by RNN architectures that directly model temporal dependencies in both directions.
  - **Training Time**: The hybrid approach added an additional computational burden, increasing the time required for training without significant accuracy improvement over simpler RNN-based architectures.

#### 5. **Discussion of Results**
- **Basic RNN**: The basic RNN had a relatively low accuracy, mainly due to its limitations in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. Its straightforward design made it the quickest to train, but its performance was subpar in comparison to the other models.

- **Stacked RNN**: Stacking RNN layers provided better abstraction and allowed the model to learn more complex representations. While it improved performance, the issue of vanishing gradients still limited its ability to capture very long sequences effectively.

- **Bi-Directional RNN**: The Bi-Directional RNN performed the best in this task because it processed the sequence both forwards and backwards, enabling it to capture information from both past and future contexts. This added bidirectional layer made it especially well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis, where both preceding and following words contribute to the meaning.

- **Hybrid CNN-RNN**: While the CNN helped in local feature extraction, the hybrid model did not surpass the Bi-Directional RNN in terms of accuracy. This suggests that the sequential nature of the task (analyzing text sequences) is better captured through RNNs, and adding CNNs may not always be beneficial, depending on the problem at hand.

#### 6. **Conclusion**
In this experiment, the Bi-Directional RNN emerged as the best-performing model, demonstrating its strength in capturing both past and future dependencies in sequence data. The stacked RNN also performed well but faced challenges with vanishing gradients, while the hybrid CNN-RNN showed potential for local feature extraction, though it did not outperform the other architectures.
